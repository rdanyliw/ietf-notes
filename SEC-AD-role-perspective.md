# Perspective on the IETF Security Area Director Role 
In the spirit of demystifying the IETF Security Area Director (AD) role, I wanted to share my practical view of being in the role for the last four and a half year (2019 – present), currently in my third 2-year term.  My hope is that by sharing this in writing, rather than in private one-on-one conversation, it will encourage current IETF community members to run for the SEC AD role.

Please remember this is my personal perspective and may not reflect the experiences of current and past SEC ADs; or ADs in other areas.  Some responsibilities will likely be missed.  Liberties will be taken in describing official process.  The relevant RFCs of course govern what needs to get done.  The various metrics that are shared with the intent to provide a sense of scale of the tasks.  Summary metrics for all ADs, including me, are in the [AD Dashboard]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/ad/).

## What needs to get done
The following is a task-oriented view of weekly activities as SEC AD.  Implicit and not formally described is that there are strategic management responsibilities for ensuring the health of the area, that appropriate security considerations for all work in the IETF is implemented; and that coordination is happening across the IETF and with relevant collaborators and stakeholder.
As SEC AD, I spend my time:

### Directly supporting “my WGs”
I’ve been responsible AD for about [15 – 16 WGs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/) (+ SecDispatch) spanning SEC and ART over my terms.  The key responsibilities are to perform AD reviews and related follow-up for document sent for publication by the WGs; handling re-charters; milestone reviews; closing the WG; answering process questions; supporting complicated consensus calls; and offline discussions about facilitation with WG chairs.  The time spent on this text is overwhelmingly dominated by reviewing documents sent for publication.

In order provide this support to WGs, routine review of WG mailing lists; attending in-person and interim meetings; and skimming documents considered for adoption is highly beneficial (needed).

Pointers and Representative Stats (March 2019 – September 2023; ~4.5 years)
* See [Documents for Roman Danyliw](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/ad/roman.danyliw) for a real-time status
* Exemplary “in flight” WG document load -- 8 WG documents are currently (September 29, 2023) with me in some state of review from being in AD Review to waiting on DISCUSSes to clear from IESG Review.
* ~90% of all documents I sent to the RFC Editor were from “my WGs” (78 / 88 document)
* ~17 – 18  documents / year have been sent to the RFC Editor from “my WGs” as AD
* Document output from WGs is not uniformly distributed.  LAMPS and OAUTH produce 40% of all “my documents.”
* ~ 1 WG closed / year – 4 WGs closed as AD (TRANS, SACM, I2NSF, SECEVENT)

### Other Document Processing
I’m sometimes approached to AD-sponsor documents which don’t fit into the charter of existing WGs or [SecDispatch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/secdispatch/about/) might recommend that a SEC AD sponsor a document.  I support on AD-sponsored documents that are bodies of work the Internet community needs and that are narrow enough in scope that a WG is not needed to significantly refine the solution.

To ensure the backlog of Publication Requests (documents sent by a WG for publication) doesn’t grow unreasonable in SEC, and to manage load due to planned absences across other areas (e.g., maternity leave), I’ve become the responsible AD for documents in WGs that I don’t oversee.  I’ve particularly appreciated the patience of the relevant WGs when this has occurred.

There is no fixed schedule for when document swaps might occur.  The SEC ADs have tried to ensure that the collective Publication Request queue is relatively empty going into each face-to-face meeting.

Prior to publication of any IRTF or ISE stream document, the IESG will be asked to perform a conflict review.  Any AD can perform these review.

Pointers and Representative Stats (March 2019 – September 2023; ~4.5 years)
* See [Documents for Roman Danyliw](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/ad/roman.danyliw) for a real-time status
* ~10% of all documents I sent to the RFC Editor were AD-sponsored or were me stepping in as responsible AD for a WG that wasn’t “mine”
* 2 - 3 documents / year are either AD sponsored by me or load-balance motivated document swap (10 / 88 documents)
* ~4 documents / year are reviewed by me for conflicts (18 total) 

### Germinating New Areas Work 
One of the most critical activities to the relevance of the SEC area is onboarding new work.  [SecDispatch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/secdispatch/about/) is a very helpful standing venue to introduce topics and get a sense of interest from the community.  One of the SEC ADs will be formally selected as the responsible AD (for the last several years, it was me), but it is a joint responsibility between both SEC ADs.  As work is often shopped around, coordination between areas (commonly ART) is often done.  While not perfect, SecDispatch as a standing venue and the efforts of the co-chairs, have been a notable time-saver for me. 

Proponents of new work will engage you directly throughout the year, or [SecDispatch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/secdispatch/about/) discussions may suggest that a BoF is needed.  Key responsibilities include vetting the proposals typically initially over email and likely over a call; BoF proposal review, preparation, and execution; and after the BoF executing the WG chartering process.

Not all BoFs need to be held at the F2F meeting.  I experimented with interim BoFs (e.g., JWP/JOSE BoF #2 and SCITT BoF #1) to decrease the time needed to start new work.

The level of AD effort needed to execute the BoF varies significantly.  It largely depends on the preparation by the participants; how socialized the idea is prior; and the engagement of the BoF chairs prior to the meeting.

The selection of WG chairs is a key decision to make if the new work ends up a chartered working group.  I tried to build each leadership team with a 1 + 1 or 2 + 1 model – one/two experienced chair(s) and one chair with no prior IETF WG chairing experience to grow the future leadership pipeline.  My two standing exceptions were SecDispatch and BoF co-chairs.  In both cases, I felt that relying on proven leadership would lead maximize the onboarding of new work.

Pointers and Representative Stats (March 2019 – September 2023; ~4.5 years)
* 4 – 5 documents per F2F SecDispatch meeting require deep review, and potentially pre- or post-meeting coordination 
* [BoF Request Tracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bof-requests)
* ~2 new WG chartered / year as responsible AD (i.e., GNAP, DANCE, SCIM, SCITT, JOSE, PPM, PQUIP, TIGRESS)
* 3 – 4 BoF requests (not all are public) / per F2F meeting
* 1 – 2 BoFs / per F2F meeting as responsible AD (e.g., for IETF 114 was JWP/JOSE and SCITT; IETF 116 was KEYTRANS; for IETF 117 was DULT; IETF 118 will be SPICE and DULT)

### Other SEC Area Tasks
Other SEC area management tasks include:
* Serving as co-chair of SAAG and Security Directorate
* Processing [errata for SEC area documents](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rec_status=2&area_acronym=sec&presentation=table)

### IESG Reviews
Every second Thursday, the IESG convenes for a formal telechat to ballot on documents, charters, and conflict reviews.  This requires reading and providing feedback on all these materials.  This task is one of the most significant time commitments of being the SEC AD role both in scope and because it has a  deadline.

### Other IESG-related Tasks
Beyond document review, the IESG also strives to ensure the continued effective operations of the IETF.  The two most visible ways this occurred is through authoring [statements]( https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/) and process improvement activities.  These activities are initiated in response to a request from the community or on the initiative of an AD(s).  Typically, a small subset of ADs work on one of these activities, and as needed, then bring back the plan or associate outputs for IESG or community review.  They greatly vary in duration and magnitude of effort.  They are rarely SEC area specific and contribute to the entire IETF community (e.g., I developed [Guidance on Reporting Protocol Vulnerabilities]( https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/vulnerabilities/)).  For a sense of what activities are in flight, review the [action items from the formal telechat agenda](https://datatracker.ietf.org/iesg/agenda/).

Underlying these kinds of activities is staying abreast of what’s happening in the broader IETF community which involves reading ietf@ietf and similar non-WG mailing list.

The IESG also has several formal liaison positions to ensure appropriate coordination with another IETF group, and the provide support as needed.  Typically, each April, after the new IESG slate is selected, ADs volunteer for these positions.
* Comm Review – (served 2020 - present) – provide on-request independent reviews of products the communications team in the IETF LLC (e.g., website, blog).  Very low-level time commitment.
* IAB liaison (served 2023 – present) – participate in practically all IAB leadership activities; and provide situational awareness and coordinate both groups on their respective activities as appropriate.  Standing commitment: an every Wednesday meeting; content reviews (e.g., statements and documents); multiple meetings during the F2F IETF meetings; and a retreat.  
* Tools liaison (served 2019 – 2021) -- make the IESG aware and provide feedback on planned or considered infrastructure changes; proxy infrastructure requests from the IESG to the Tools leadership team; and engage the community on changes which require consultation.  Standing commitment: a monthly meeting; and an unpredictable number of IESG tools requests and community consultations (e.g., [Retire FTP](https://github.com/ietf/ftp-retirement-consult-2020) / [RFC9141]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9141/); Deploy Web Analytics [consultation]( https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/5NLuTQfU60dXOzr4iH5hs4feIIw/) and [plan]( https://www.ietf.org/documents/293/www.ietf.org-AnalyticsProposal-forReview.pdf))
* NomCom (served for 2021 NOMCOM) – participate in the NomCom as a non-voting, liaison member.  Standing commitment: numerous, remote multi-hour meetings in the November – January timeframe while NomCom conducts its business.
* [Education and Outreach (EODIR)]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/eodir/about/) (no first-hand experience) – liaison to EODIR 
* Technical Deep Dive ([TDD](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tdd/about/)) (no first-hand experience) – liaison to TDD planning and execution

A few IESG volunteers are also requested to participate in [IAB Administrative Support] Groups(https://datatracker.ietf.org/program/) such as [IETF-IANA]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ietfiana/), [IETF-IEEE]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ietfieee/) and IETF-3GPP.  My personal experience with the IANA and IEEE groups is a quarterly meeting with some follow-up if there was related work.

Once a year, the IESG has a retreat to discuss more strategic topics.  These meetings generate many follow-up action items on process improvement activities.

## Workflow
I organize my AD workflow around the following standing events which had hard deadlines, and interleave other tasks as needed.

* Every week
   * The SEC ADs (Paul and me; and previously Ben and me) have a coordination call to discuss whatever was needed (e.g., documents on the telechat; BoF requests; AD sponsorship requests)
    * Telechat (two week cycle)
         * Every two weeks, there is a [Formal IESG Telechat](https://datatracker.ietf.org/iesg/agenda/) which requires balloting on a docket of documents, charters, and conflict reviews
         * On the other week when there isn’t a Formal IESG Telechat, there is an [Informal IESG Telechat]( https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iesg/InformalAgenda) which requires review of non-document artifacts
* Three times a year, this cadence of the IESG telechat is interrupted by the face-to-face (F2F) meetings
* At least once a year, typically April or May, the IESG convenes for a retreat
* BoF proposals for the upcoming F2F needed to be vetted, polished and approved approximately 1.5 – 2 months before the upcoming meeting

### Formal and Informal Telechat Cycle
There is a two-week cycle for the formal and informal telechats.  Every other week, the entire IESG must ballot on the current slate of documents, charters, and conflict reviews which concludes with a standing 2-hour meeting on Thursdays.  On the other week in the cycle, the IESG convenes to informally discuss topics for a standing 2-hour meeting also on Thursdays.

Preparing for the formal telechat is a significant commitment of time for every meeting.  The informal telechat might require some preparation, but no where near the same level unless there was a significant topic I was personally preparing.  The informal meeting is sometimes canceled.  In the final weeks before F2F meetings, there may be back-to-back formal telechat weeks to ensure documents and charters can be processed before the meeting.

### Face to face meetings
There are three face-to-face meetings a year for which attendance is expected.  Preparation for these meeting begins before arriving on-site.

About half-way before the next F2F meeting, there is a deadline for BoF requests.  In the weeks prior to that, BoF proponents will engage you to make their case for a BoF.  SEC typically sees 3 – 4 proposals submitted (sometimes not all formally) every cycle with ~1 – 2 BOFs held at every F2F meeting.  The degree of prior preparation by the proponents directly dictates the level of effort of this activity.  Some level of sustained effort (e.g., talking with the proponents, reviewing materials, etc.) is needed before the meeting

Two weeks before the F2F meeting, an “Internet-Draft submission cut-off” prohibits draft submissions prior to that meeting.  In the few days before this deadline, there is usually a huge spike of updated internet-drafts submitted as authors will try to address pending DISCUSSes or AD Review feedback.  Historically, I tried to review all these revised documents to clear DISCUSSes I hold; or advance documents to IETF Last Call, IESG Review or the RFC Editor.  This will take at least several full days.  When considering that travel to the F2F meeting may start on Friday, this re-review of document and advanced reading of materials for WG meetings, may occupy my whole week for arriving at the meeting.

Attending the face-to-face meeting is not a new commitment when becoming the SEC AD.  However, in the role, you will be fully booked from Sunday – Friday.  Due to the number of WGs in the SEC area, there is a WG for which you are responsible or a BOF convened in nearly meeting slot. If you want to attend a non-SEC WG meeting or a relevant side meeting, you are skipping the meeting of a WG for which you are responsible.  There is also SEC area office hours and the SECDIR meeting to convene.  The IESG has multi-hour standing meeting on Sunday and on Friday afternoon; and at least two morning meetings during the week.

### Retreat
Over the course of the year, it is highly likely there will be an IESG retreat, possible also with the IAB.  It is a 2 – 3 day meetings involving travel.  These are full day commitments with various preparation needed. 

## Exemplary Work Weeks for Roman
My primary strategy is to timebox commitments to ensure progress is made on all required AD tasks.

### Formal Telechat Week
The key priority for the week is ensuring that everything on the formal telechat that coming Thursday has been reviewed.  The agenda for the formal telechat is published the Friday before.  I’ll typically scan it then to determine what my upcoming week looks like.  I may start reviewing the documents over the weekend if my job schedule looks full or I have paid time off (vacation) in the coming week; or if documents look like they may be time intensive to review.  The maximum review load for WG or AD-sponsored documents is 400 pages per telechat.  If the page count approaches that limit, it will likely take me all of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to complete reviews and ballot – those can be long days, especially if there are competing day job commitments.  There might be some final reviews on Thursday before the meeting.  Barring minor tasks or something critical, other IETF tasks are deferred to after the telechat.  Each formal telechat will not have the maximum load and the required effort is reduced if “my documents” (i.e., from “my WGs”) are on the docket.

One key difference between SEC and other areas is that there is the possibility for a security issue in almost all non-process documents.  Therefore, they all need to be reviewed.

### Informal Telechat Week
The focus of the informal telechat week is to address all other IETF business.  The bulk of the time is spent performing AD Review of my WG’s, following up on ballot feedback shared the week prior or three weeks before.  I typically run through (My Documents)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/ad/roman.danyliw] page trying to make some progress in all categories – DISCUSS positions; Publication Requested; and things marked as AD Follow-Up which have been approved by the IESG.  I also use this time to engage my peer ADs to clear their DISCUSSes on my WG’s documents.  This load of this week varies greatly. This is the week where sustained blocks of time focused on the day job are more easily accommodated.

### F2F Meeting Weeks
These meetings will be focused entirely meeting business.  See above.

## Common Question

### How much time does it take to be SEC AD?
The IETF is a volunteer organization.  It will take all the time you give it.  Even as a full-time role, there would always be more to do.

The SEC AD role is entirely what you make of it.  Starting with a 50 – 60% IETF effort budget is not an unrealistic baseline commitment for the SEC area realizing that the load surges and ebb some.

There are numerous ways to calibrate this effort.  These include: 
* how focused are your AD and IESG reviews;
* how quickly you perform AD reviews;
* how willing you are to AD-sponsor documents;
* how willing you are to load balance with peers;
* how much many mailing lists you are willing to read and engage on if specific action is not required of you;
* how willing you are to engage in non-document IESG tasks; and
* how much effort you’ll expend on bringing in new work and working with proponents.

### How long does it take to onboard into the AD role?
My experience was that it took at least 6 – 9 months, and at least two F2F meetings, for me to really understand most of the dimensions of the role.  

I’ve heard that some believe that it takes the first AD term to really understand the job.  With the perspective of being in my third term, I agree that by the time I entered the second AD term I felt more effective.

I’ve also heard that in the beginning of your first term, the AD role might take more time as you are trying to learn the processes and become familiar with work outside of the core IETF areas in which you previously worked.  My experience is that this was not true.  Yes, in my first 1 – 2 years of performing AD reviews and balloting on documents, I didn’t have the background on various protocols and had to spend more time reading references.  As I became familiar with more bodies of work, I had less of a ramp-up on certain classes of technologies.  I also likely became more selective in how I filled DISCUSSes.  However, as I found efficiencies in various processes, I didn’t reduce my committed IETF time.  My increased experience with processes and accrued situational awareness of WG/community dynamics meant that I was able to take on other AD obligations that I was likely neglecting in trying to initially get up to speed.

### Did you know the various IETF processes before you become an AD?
I knew little about IETF processes when I became an AD beyond what you see as a document author, WG/BoF chair, reading the ietf@ietf list and attending the plenary.  With great appreciation, Ben Kaduk (co-SEC AD) was extremely giving and patient in helping me navigate the processes early in my term.  Another enormous thank you goes to the Secretariat, IANA staff and Robert Sparks – they will not let you do the wrong thing; and are the institutional memory for infrequently done things or the rationale for why “things are just done that way.”  In short, someone will help get you up to speed.

### Is there additional travel when AD?
Beyond the three times a year face-to-face meeting, there is typically a multi-day IESG leadership retreat requiring travel.  In recent years these retreat venues have been Seattle/US (2023), San Francisco/US (2022), Amsterdam/NL (2019), Toronto/CA (2019).

### How do you balance “day-job” commitments?
One of the key enablers I found is that many of the most time-intensive tasks such as document reviews can be performed on any schedule.  This allowed me to keep specific time-based commitment to my employer and also allows me to flex into non-core business hours to meet IETF deadlines.  Additionally, having larger blocks of time to work on “day job” tasks on the weeks of the informal telechat are crucial.

There is a particular tension when you work multiple jobs concurrently – IETF and the “day job”.  Unless managed, both often assume you are working on “their tasks” and can surge based on flexibility in the “other role”.  It has been important to communicate constraints between the roles.

### Is it possible to take vacation?
Absolutely! My experience is that all those that I engaged with in the AD role were respectful of when I took paid-time-off.  It is in fact possible to “ignore AD responsibilities for a week or even two” if there is a vacation or even are urgent day job constraints.

### How did you convince your management to let you be AD?
I don’t have a good, reusable answer.  My management, likely because my employer is an academic institution, has always recognized the need and professional obligation (and benefit) to serve in professional organizations and societies in all our workforce.  It didn’t take much convincing.  I appreciate that this is not a common situation.

### What is your interaction with other ADs?
There is frequent interaction with other ADs.  I work most closely with Paul (and Ben, prior) since we jointly manage the SEC area.  As mentioned previously, Paul and I have a weekly meeting.  There is also a standing telechat meeting every week with the rest of the IESG.  

In recent years, throughout the week, the ADs are in touch with each other over a dedicate Slack channel for matters large and small.  My experience is that it is easy to get a hold of almost any AD if I need their counsel.
